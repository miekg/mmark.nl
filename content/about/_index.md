## Mmark

Mmark is a powerful markdown processor written in Go geared towards writing IETF documents. It is,
however, *also* suited for writing books and other technical documentation.

You can write RFCs using markdown, it provides an advanced markdown dialect that processes
a (single) file to produce internet-drafts in XML format. Internet-drafts written in Mmark can
produce xml2rfc v3 and HTML5 output.

Example documents can be [found here](https://github.com/miekg/mmark/tree/master/rfc).

It also allows for writing large documents such as technical books, like the
[Learning Go book](https://miek.nl/go).

Mmark is a fork of [blackfriday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday/).
