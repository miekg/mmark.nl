Mmark is a powerful markdown processor written in Go, geared towards writing IETF documents. It is,
however, *also* suited for writing books and other technical documentation.

You can write RFCs using markdown, it provides an advanced markdown dialect that processes
file(s) to produce internet-drafts in XML [RFC 7991](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7991)
format. Mmark can produce XML2RFC (aforementioned RFC 7991) and HTML5 output.

Example documents can be [found here](https://github.com/mmarkdown/mmark/tree/master/rfc).

It also allows for writing large documents such as technical books, like the
[Learning Go book](https://miek.nl/go).

Mmark uses [gomarkdown](https://github.com/gomarkdown/markdown) which is a fork of
[blackfriday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday/).

If you like Go and parsing text, drop me a line if you want to be part of the *Mmarkdown* Github
org, and help develop Mmark!
