Mmark is a powerful markdown processor written in Go, geared towards writing IETF documents. It is,
however, *also* suited for writing books and other technical documentation, like the [Learning Go
book](https://miek.nl/go).

It provides an advanced markdown dialect that processes file(s) to produce internet-drafts in XML
[RFC 7991](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7991) format. Mmark can produce XML2RFC (aforementioned
RFC 7991) and HTML5 output.

Example documents can be [found in the Github repository](https://github.com/mmarkdown/mmark/tree/master/rfc).

Mmark uses [gomarkdown](https://github.com/gomarkdown/markdown) which is a fork of
[blackfriday](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday/).

If you like Go and parsing text, drop me (<mailto:miek@miek.nl>) a line if you want to be part of
the *Mmarkdown* Github org, and help develop Mmark!
