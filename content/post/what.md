Mmark is a powerful markdown dialect that allows you to generate HTML pages,
[books](https://miek.nl/go), manual pages and you can generate Internet-Drafts/RFC when writing for the
IETF - mmark was created for the latter.

See here [how to start](https://mmark.miek.nl/post/start/) writing documents.
