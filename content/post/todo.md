Until Mmark (v2) development has been deemed stable (couple of weeks of, so somewhere in September
2018), everything on this site has to be considered in a state of flux and **TODO**.

The ultimate aim is:

* Consistent and complete documentation of Mmark's syntax.
* Detailing the hoops you need to jump through for generating the correct XML for the IETF. 
* Have it all being discoverable and readable.
